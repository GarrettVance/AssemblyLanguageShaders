This repository derives from the NVIDIA cg_ShinySprites demo for OpenGL. 

The specific source code distribution I used as my starting point was distributed by NVIDIA in the year 2007.

I cannot name all those who contributed to the NVIDIA code, but some of the 
names which appeared many times in my research are

Kurt Akeley,
Mark Kilgard,
Brian Paul,
Cass Everitt,
Tristan Lorach,
Chris Wynn,
Mark Harris.
